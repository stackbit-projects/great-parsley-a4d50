> Canggu is an area in Center-West Bali. It is just above Seminyak (the hip trendy area), and just below the famous Tanah Lot temple.

> There are many stylish things to see and do in the Goo including: checking out cafe racers on the streets, drinking some freshly brewed Americanos, riding long long waves on Batu Bolong beach, and just chilling out.

> Some of my favorite joints in the area are Machinery Cafe Bali (MCB) and the Deus Ex Machina cafe. You can find fast internet there!
